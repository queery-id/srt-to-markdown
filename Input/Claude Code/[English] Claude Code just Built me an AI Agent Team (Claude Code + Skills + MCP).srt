1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
I use clot more than any other AI but

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,160
even I dismiss Clark as just for

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,960
developers and I was wrong after using

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,880
myself I am completely so and this is

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,679
too powerful to ignore if you want to

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,240
use AI to build system and do work for

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,720
you end to end not just chatting and

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,039
copy pasting so in this video I'll share

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,439
how to get started with cloud code even

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,000
if you don't use for coding and most

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,400
importantly how to use it to build an AI

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,680
work team and system that you can

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,640
actually use. Let's go.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,360
So why claw code is even needed if claw

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,280
is already so powerful. So most people

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,440
use cloud projects with custom

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,239
instructions to turn claw into AI

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,960
agents. But they are silo. You end up

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,520
copy and pasting between them. You are

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,840
the coordinator. But with cloud code is

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,640
different. So these cloud agents share

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,120
the same workspace access to the same

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,600
context file. They can talk to each

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,080
other and hands up work automatically

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,479
each with their own token context window

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,799
and claude now becomes the team lead.

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,640
You give the direction they execute

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,560
together and that is what we are

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,720
building today. So each of these cloud

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,200
code agents you create needs at least

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,360
three core components all defined in one

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
single markdown file. the role and

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,320
responsibilities, the knowledge like

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,880
workflow details, reusable clot agent

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,720
skills, the MCP tools that they have

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,119
access to. For this demo, we'll be

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,439
building a five agent work and claude,

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,920
our main agent will add as our team lead

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,000
to coordinate between these agent. A

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,159
bonus tip is when designing your AI

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,079
teammate, give them specific and

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,159
non-over overlapping roles to minimize

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,759
the potential conflicts. Now, to get

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,159
started with clark code, there are four

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,079
main ways to access it. First, the local

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,079
terminal. This is the raw method and

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,000
will give you the best experience.

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,920
Luckily, Anthroporic just launched a

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,920
native installer. So, which makes it

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,079
really easy to install. I'll put the

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,799
official link below. And second, ID

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,360
extension. So, you can add CL code to ID

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,360
like VS Code or Kursa and let you run

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,599
the CL code and see the project file

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,440
structure side by side. Third, the cloud

56
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,599
web app where you can click the code tab

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,440
and run the CL code in the cloud, but it

58
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,840
requires you linking to a GitHub

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,000
repository. and fourth, cloud desktop

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,160
app which has cloud code built-in and

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
this is what we'll be using today. Now,

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,680
whatever way you choose, I still highly

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,760
recommend installing cloud code through

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
the terminal first because the terminal

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,239
gives you the most complete experience.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,160
All commands and features work fully

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,239
since we're running Clark locally. So,

68
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,319
the first thing is to set up a local

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,720
project folder. So, think of it like a

70
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,720
dedicated workspace for Clark. So, let's

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
say I run a marketing agency and I'm

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,800
setting up the TIM system. So let's

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,120
create a folder called marketing team

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,519
and then I highly recommend to include

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,000
all useful business context about this

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,080
agency brand. Then access code using

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,319
whatever method that you choose. So for

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,519
our case we will use cloud desktop

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,519
application. So navigate to Clark pick

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,239
local as the environment and then pick

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,720
the folder we just create. Now before we

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,959
even create any agents the very first

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,599
step is to initiate this project by

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,519
creating a cloth.md file. So this is

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,760
just like a project system prompt. It

86
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,920
gives all the important context to cla

87
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
about what it should know. So ask claw

88
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,480
to read the business context file and

89
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,480
create a cloth.md file and to build the

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,560
necessary folder structure. So

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,640
immediately cloth has created all the

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,879
folders for this agency brand. And we

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,799
can even open up an ID to doublech

94
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,720
checkck all the folders and the cloth

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,319
empty file. All right. Now let's build

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,480
our first teammate the content

97
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,680
strategies. So this is the simplest

98
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,000
version. No clock scales, no MCP tools,

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
just the basic context file. A key

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
features of clock code is the slash

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,840
command. So you can type slash to

102
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,920
trigger these built-in shortcuts. And

103
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,760
there are lots of them and most of them

104
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,920
are really for coding purpose. So I

105
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,959
won't go through them one by one today.

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,760
But for agent creation, we need the CLI

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,000
terminal because the Asian commands is

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,560
not fully supported in a chat interface

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,720
yet. So first type claw just to initiate

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,720
a session. So this way you can trigger

111
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,799
the terminal and don't be scared.

112
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,120
Basically this is just a raw sections

113
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,840
for cloud code and a chat interface is

114
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,079
just like a wpper. Now type / agents to

115
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,639
trigger the building cloth agent

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,600
configuration. Then select create new

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,479
agent. Pick project level agent as this

118
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,720
agents is for this project only. Then

119
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,040
pick generate with clot. So here you can

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,360
describe what this agent will do. So in

121
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,520
our case, this is a content strategist

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,160
agent that will do web search and

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,639
prepare content research documents in MD

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,520
files. Then select the tools default

125
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,600
clock model color for this agent to use.

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,759
And now we're done. We have create our

127
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,199
first clot agents for this work team.

128
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,680
And whenever you want to call this

129
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,600
agent, just tag this agent name in any

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,400
cloud code session. So we can double

131
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,639
check using the VS code IDE and you will

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,040
see from the folder it has created the

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,639
agent under the agents folder. So

134
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,880
basically it's just an empty file

135
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,880
containing the system prompt defining

136
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,520
the role and the capabilities for this

137
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,039
agent and you can always change it since

138
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,360
this agent will also use different

139
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,039
strategy templates. We can also ask it

140
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
to create all the necessary templates

141
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,919
that this agent will use. And this is

142
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,240
the power of CL code because it not only

143
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,639
created files for you but also put it in

144
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,280
the right folder according to this team

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,440
system structure. So no more copy and

146
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
paste. Immediately these templates have

147
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,080
been created under the template folder

148
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,400
like the campaign plan content brief

149
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,880
content strategy template. So they are

150
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,720
really detailed and this is fantastic.

151
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,199
Now to use this agent in a chat

152
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,600
interface just tag this agent or just

153
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,919
use plain language to specify the agent

154
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,400
name and ask it to research the latest

155
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,479
SEO challenges and prepare a content

156
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,639
brief. So you will see it will trigger

157
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,720
different web searches and also reading

158
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,960
the content brief template file that it

159
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,440
just create and then after a few minutes

160
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,160
the content brief is ready and this is

161
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,840
super comprehensive and the agent has

162
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,840
followed everything stated in the

163
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,000
template. So do not just create an

164
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,800
agent. Always give it context,

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,880
templates, resource, standard rules to

166
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,960
follow. So it will always produce

167
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,720
quality output like this. Now that you

168
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,880
have seen how easy it is to build

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,280
content agents with AI, here is the

170
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,520
catch. Consumers have strong opinions

171
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,520
about AI generated content. If you want

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,759
to understand what they actually think

173
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,440
and how to implement AI without losing

174
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,600
their trust, this free report from

175
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,520
HubSpot and Survey Monkey, how brands

176
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,000
are earning loyalty in an automated

177
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,759
world covers exactly that in detail. You

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
can find the link below based on the

179
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,199
data from over 15,000 consumers

180
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,919
globally. Only 24% of consumers actually

181
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,960
like seeing AI in their emails, ads, or

182
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,199
customer support. And 84% want to know

183
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,520
when brands are using AI. That is a

184
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,759
trust gap you need to close. And what I

Survey Monkey for sponsoring this video.

193
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,680
All right, let's create our second

194
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,080
agent, a presentation specialist. And

195
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,080
this time, let's also add clock agent

196
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,240
skills. So skills are just like a

197
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,560
reusable instruction manual that tells

198
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,400
claw how to execute your task and

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,800
particularly for this agent we'll use

200
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,880
the official document creation skills.

201
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,360
So enthrop provide a list of official

202
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,919
skills but they are not pre-built inside

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,479
clock. So you can go to this official

204
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,639
skills GitHub repository and the easiest

205
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,360
and reliable way is to use the building

206
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,319
plug-in command inside clock. So type

207
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,039
/plugin and register the official skill

208
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,120
repository and then install the document

209
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,000
skills and also I recommend to install

210
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,400
the example skills to enable all other

211
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,160
official skills as well. Then we can use

212
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
this prompt to double confirm these

213
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,639
skills are successfully made available

214
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,039
inside cloud code. Now again use the

215
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,680
embedded terminal inside cloud desktop

216
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,599
and use the agent configuration mode to

217
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,080
create these presentation specialist

218
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,199
agent. This agent will transform all the

219
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,360
data into pawn slide decks. Note I also

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,440
specify the brand color palettes here.

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,680
So this agent will always follow these

222
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,080
color tone when generating the slides.

223
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,840
Then quickly we have our second agent

224
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,000
builds. So let's say we have this

225
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,479
performing data set inside this data

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,800
folder. Then we can just tag this agent

227
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,039
name and then ask it to create a

228
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,719
presentation deck for this file under

229
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,800
our folder. And if you're using the

230
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,279
terminal, you can just simply tag the

231
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,440
file path which will be much easier. Now

232
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,720
it triggers the document creation skills

233
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,640
that we have in store and out of film it

234
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,279
create a performance report presentation

235
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,360
for us with 10 slides. So it is quite

236
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,920
decent and is using the color scheme

237
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,880
that we have defined with the color box

238
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,200
charts graphs for storytelling. Although

239
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,120
it's not using very sophisticated

240
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,519
graphics, it's definitely ready to

241
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,519
present and with minimal adjustment. And

242
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,560
so perhaps maybe you have different data

243
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,640
sets, documents, reports. You don't even

244
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,040
need to upload them. You can just put

245
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,279
them inside a folder and then let claw

246
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,120
to scan and load them and call this

247
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,600
agent to build the deck for you. All

248
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,680
right, our third agent which is a data

249
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,800
analyst. So this time we'll be adding

250
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,440
MCP tools. So MCP less clock connect to

251
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,000
external system and retrieve live data

252
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,399
or context and this is where your AI

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,480
team become truly powerful. So first we

254
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,560
need to install all the necessary MCB

255
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
server and make them available on cloud

256
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,080
code. So if you have been using cloud

257
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,720
desktop you probably already have a list

258
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,880
of MCB servers connected. So the easiest

259
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,959
way is to input them through the local

260
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,200
terminal. So we need to use the

261
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,839
computer's local terminal is because the

262
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,560
embedded one in the clock desktop does

263
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,120
not support this import command. So open

264
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,080
the terminal application. So navigate to

265
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,680
our project folder path using this cd

266
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,320
command. Then use this command mcp at

267
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,800
from clot desktop to import the mcp

268
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,519
servers that you want. So in this case I

269
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,959
have import three mcp servers. Notion

270
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,959
hrefs j4. notes depending on the MCP

271
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,440
server that you install some of them

272
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,519
might require further authentication

273
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,079
before you can use them on cloud code

274
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,720
and to confirm it's already installed go

275
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,839
back to cloud desktop open the terminal

276
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,560
type /mcp and we can see all the three

277
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,959
MCP servers are available now repeat the

278
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,519
same process to build this data analyst

279
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,079
agent with the agent command so this

280
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,040
agent will connect to J4 through the MCP

281
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,440
tool and create parnish interactive HTML

282
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,519
dashboard and again we will use the same

283
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,079
brand color palettes to keep everything

284
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,320
on brand and then now we have three

285
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,880
agents in a team. So let's test this

286
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,880
agent to analyze our website performance

287
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,519
and build a dashboard. So it's now

288
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,160
calling the J4 MCB server to retrieve

289
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,560
the data and quickly it has built us a

290
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,560
dashboard with the photo path. So it is

291
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,120
in the same brand color we have

292
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,079
specified with the executive summary,

293
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,560
key metrics boxes, interactive charts,

294
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,800
trend lines and this is what club really

295
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,040
excels at about strategic storytelling

296
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,200
and insights. Then we can even export

297
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,040
this directly as a PDF file which is

298
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,360
ready to send out to the team for quick

299
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,279
sharing. Now let's level up further. So

300
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,760
we'll create custom skills that make our

301
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,000
agents even more brand specific. And

302
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,160
then we'll build a fourth agent, a

303
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,320
social media specialist who will use

304
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,000
these custom skills. So let's create a

305
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,000
custom skills called branded social

306
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,160
visuals which will be used for creating

307
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,480
branded social graphics. So upload some

308
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,560
visual example for cloth and then ask it

309
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,720
to read the official canvas design

310
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,000
skills and extend it for visual

311
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,880
creations with the specified brand color

312
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,959
layout style for this agency brand. So

313
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,760
now it triggers the official skills

314
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,160
creator we have enabled and studies the

315
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,639
canvas design skills and then extends it

316
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,120
and create a new custom skills following

317
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,760
the official structure. And from the ID

318
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,240
explorer we can also see a new skill MD

319
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,480
file is generated. And so using this

320
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,800
same method, we can create a few more

321
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,279
custom skills perhaps like a keyword

322
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,160
research skills that we call the HF's

323
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,320
MCP and LLM optimized the blog writer

324
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,800
skills that generate AI search friendly

325
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,800
blog and a custom brand voice skills. So

326
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,519
if you want to learn how to build these

327
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,760
custom skills, go check out this video.

328
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,240
So let's see this in action with the

329
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,440
social media specialist agent which will

330
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,920
use this custom skills and a notion MCP.

331
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,920
So we can give it some topic ideas and

332
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,240
ask it to drop the post copy with

333
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,240
visuals and schedule them on our notion

334
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
calendar. So it is now calling the

335
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,399
branded social visual skill we just

336
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,040
create for visual creation and then

337
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,200
calls the notion MCP to upload all the

338
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,279
post details to our calendar. And now

339
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,279
all the visuals have been created under

340
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,360
this folder. Although these visuals are

341
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,200
not that fancy, it's also not cloth

342
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,519
strain, but definitely you can see

343
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,440
everything is on brand using the brand

344
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,320
color pallets and with the brand test

345
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,800
logo. So these workflow automation is

346
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,360
100% working. And you can always let

347
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,920
claw use all the image generation model

348
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,399
perhaps Gemini Nano Banana for more

349
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,560
stunning visual images. And claw also

350
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,720
successfully schedule all these posts on

351
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,040
the notion content calendar following

352
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,240
our posting schedule with the platform

353
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,120
details, posting status, postcopy,

354
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,519
hashtag. So this is what make clock so

355
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,760
powerful. Everything can be done like in

356
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,639
30 minutes. Now we have built our AI

357
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,880
team. Four agents you have seen plus an

358
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,800
SEO content specialist I created the

359
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,120
same way. So here comes the most

360
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,240
exciting part is watching them working

361
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,399
together. But before we do that, Clot

362
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,800
needs to know when and who to delegate

363
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,639
it to. So remember the clock empty file

364
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,199
we created in the very first step. So

365
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,680
the key here is to ask claw to review

366
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,320
all the agents in this workspace and

367
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,720
then update that clock.md file with the

368
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,880
agent routing rules. So these are the

369
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,199
instructions that tell claw which agent

370
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,120
to call for different tasks and what are

371
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,040
the trigger phrase and this is an

372
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,279
important step to make the whole system

373
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,279
work. So now it has add these routing

374
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,160
rules that define when it should

375
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,560
delegate to this agent and it even add a

376
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,720
section for the multi- aent workflow

377
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,040
which is amazing and let's test it with

378
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,279
a multi- aent workflow. So we will ask

379
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,519
it to do content research about a

380
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,480
content topic and then create a blog

381
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,639
post and also a presentation deck based

382
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,120
on this content research findings. And

383
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,600
that means both the blog writing and

384
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,079
presentation task will depend on the

385
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,160
first task of content research. So you

386
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,880
can see it start with the first task and

387
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,720
cause the content strategist agent to do

388
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,199
the research through the web search. So

389
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,279
once the task has been complete, it now

390
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,560
move on to the next task for the blog

391
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,880
post creation and dedicate to our SEO

392
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,880
content specialist and the agent now

393
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,920
triggers the keyword research skills

394
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,160
that cause the HFS MCP and then it also

395
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,240
triggers the block writing and document

396
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,880
skills for the actual blog content

397
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,959
creation. Now it move on to the client

398
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,519
presentation task and calls the

399
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,600
presentation agent which will use the

400
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,360
PowerPoint creation skills. So all the

401
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,279
tasks have been done and claw is just

402
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,519
like your team lead give you the summary

403
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,000
for all the deliverables and the agents

404
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,320
that it use. So first the content brief

405
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,399
about the topic backed by research that

406
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,639
is really detailed and follows the

407
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,959
predefined format which is a great

408
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,279
starting point and then the blog post is

409
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,600
pretty impressive as well. So following

410
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,759
all the required formats to make it AI

411
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,079
search friendly, use of bullet points,

412
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,480
FAQ sections and I particularly like

413
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,639
this section about the 10 common pricing

414
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,360
mistake which is great for AI search

415
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,600
engines and what is amazing is I can see

416
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,759
this blog is following the content brief

417
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,560
done by the other agent the content

418
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,800
structure talking points and has almost

419
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,440
5,000 words and you can further enhance

420
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,920
it perhaps also like claw to upload for

421
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,759
you to your final CMS platform and if

422
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,759
you want any of your blog documents to

423
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,519
match your branding and formatting. You

424
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,600
can always create custom branded skills

425
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,680
that use your branded template like how

426
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,000
we did just now. And for the deck is

427
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,000
also using our branded theme. So

428
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,560
everything is on brand and the content

429
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,480
is also using the same content research

430
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,720
findings. So basically all the

431
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,120
deliverables are coherent and aligned to

432
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,000
deliver the same story and this is the

433
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,160
true AI orchestration in action. And now

434
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,880
we have different Asians to achieve a

435
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,639
big task and execute agentic workflows

436
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,560
like this. All right, there are still so

437
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,959
many possibilities and use cases with

438
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,720

439
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,040
