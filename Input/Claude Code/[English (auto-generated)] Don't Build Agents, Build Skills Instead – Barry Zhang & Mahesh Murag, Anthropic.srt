[music]

2
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,880
All right, good morning and thank you

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,359
for having us again. Last time we were

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,960
here, we're still figuring out what an

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,439
agent even is. Today, many of us are

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,000
using agents on a daily basis. But we

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
still notice gaps. We still have slots,

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,320
right? Agents have intelligence and

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,320
capabilities, but not always expertise

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,120
that we need for real work. I'm Barry.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,719
This is Mahes. We created agent skills.

12
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,480
In this talk, we'll show you why we

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,160
stopped building agents and started

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,680
building skills instead.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,039
A lot of things have changed since our

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,280
last talk. MCP became the standard for

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,680
agent connectivity. Cloud Code, our

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,359
first coding agent, launched to the

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,000
world and our cloud agent SDK now

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
provides a production ready agent out of

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,799
the box. We have a more mature ecosystem

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,640
and we're moving towards a new paradigm

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,119
for agents. That paradigm is a tighter

24
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,520
coupling between the model and a runtime

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,600
environment.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,000
Put simply, we think code is all we

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,720
need.

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,159
We used to think agents in different

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,920
domains will look very different. Each

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,759
one will need its own tools and

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,360
scaffolding and that means we'll have a

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,119
separate agent for each use case for

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,920
each domain. Well, customization is

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,079
still important for each domain. The

35
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,600
agent underneath is actually more

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,400
universal than we thought.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
What we realized is that code is not

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
just a use case but the universal

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,880
interface to the digital world.

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
After we built cloud code, we realized

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
that cloud code is actually a general

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,799
purpose agent.

43
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,079
Think about generating a financial

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,640
report. The model can call the API to

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,479
pull in data and do research. It can

46
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,320
organize that data in the file system.

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,159
It can analyze it with Python and then

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,079
synthesize the insight in old file

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,719
format all through code. The core

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,479
scaffolding can suddenly become as thin

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,039
as just bash and file system which is

52
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,200
great and really scalable. But we very

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,080
quickly run into a different problem

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,879
and that problem is domain expertise.

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,480
Who do you want doing your taxes? Is it

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,080
going to be Mahesh, the 300 IQ

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,480
mathematical genius, or is it Barry, an

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800
experienced tax professional, right? I

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,640
would pick Barry every time. I don't

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
want Mahesh to figure out the 2025 tax

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,959
code from first principles. I need

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,280
consistent execution from from a domain

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,599
expert. As agents today are a lot like

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,599
Mahes. They're brilliant, but they lack

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,599
expertise.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,879
They can do no more slow. They can do

67
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
amazing things when you really put in

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
the effort and give proper guidance, but

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,239
they're often missing the important

70
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,840
context up front. They can't really

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
absorb your expertise super well, and

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,400
they don't learn over time.

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,640
That's why we created agent skills.

74
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,560
Skills are organized collections of

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,640
files that package composable procedural

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,200
knowledge for agents.

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,159
In other words, they're folders. This

78
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,080
simplicity is deliberate. We want

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,480
something that anyone human or agent can

80
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,640
create and use as long as they have a

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,280
computer. These also work with what you

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
already have. You can version them in

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,959
Git, you can throw them in Google Drive

84
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,560
and you can zip them up and share with

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,519
your team. We have used files for uh as

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,519
a primitive for decades and we like

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,519
them. So why change now?

88
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,120
Because of that skills can also include

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,680
a lot of scripts as tools. Traditional

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,519
tools have pretty obvious problems. Some

91
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,280
tools have poorly written instructions

92
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,840
and are pretty ambiguous and when the

93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
model is struggling, it can't really

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
make a change to the tool. So, it's just

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,040
kind of stuck with a code start problem

96
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
and they always live in the context

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,720
window. Code solves some of these

98
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,879
issues. It's self-documenting. It is

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,959
modifiable and can live in the file

100
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,879
system until they're really needed and

101
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,080
used. Here's an example of a script

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,799
inside of a skill. We kept seeing Claude

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,400
write the same Python script over and

104
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,560
over again to apply styling to slides.

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
So we just ask cloud to save it inside

106
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,799
of the skill as a tool for his version

107
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
for his future self. Now we can just run

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,040
the script and that makes everything a

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
lot more consistent and a lot more

110
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,320
efficient.

111
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,840
At this point skills can contain a lot

112
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,600
of information and we want to protect

113
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
the context window so that we can fit in

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,199
hundreds of skills and make them truly

115
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
composable. That's why skills are

116
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
progressively disclosed. At runtime,

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,800
only this metadata is shown to the model

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
just to indicate that he has the skill.

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,440
When an agent needs to use a skill, it

120
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,600
can read in the rest of the skill.md,

121
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,440
which contains the core instruction and

122
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,639
directory for the rest of the folder.

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,440
Everything else is just organized for

124
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,080
ease of access. So that's all skills

125
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
are. They're organized folders with

126
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,600
scripts as tools.

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
Since our launch five weeks ago, this

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,639
very simple design has translated into a

129
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,560
very quickly growing ecosystem of

130
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
thousands of skills. And we've seen this

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,560
be split across a couple of different

132
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
types of skills. There are foundational

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,120
skills, third party skills created by

134
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,360
partners in the ecosystem, and skills

135
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
built within an enterprise and within

136
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,840
teams.

137
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,240
To start, foundational skills are those

138
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,320
that give agents new general

139
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
capabilities or domain specific

140
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,360
capabilities that it didn't have before.

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,199
We ourselves with our launch built

142
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,039
document skills that give Claude the

143
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,919
ability to create and edit professional

144
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,639
quality office documents. We're also

145
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,160
really excited to see people like

146
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,360
Cadence build scientific research skills

147
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,520
that give Claude new capabilities like

148
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
EHR data analysis and using common

149
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,639
Python bioinformatics libraries better

150
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,120
than it could before.

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
We've also seen partners in the

152
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,759
ecosystem build skills that help Claude

153
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
better with their own software and their

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,479
own products. Browserbase is a pretty

155
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,479
good example of this. They built a skill

156
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,319
for their open- source browser

157
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,960
automation tooling, stage hand. And now

158
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
Claude equipped that this skill and with

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,240
stage hand can now go navigate the web

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
and use a browser more effectively to

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,919
get work done.

162
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,919
And notion launched a bunch of skills

163
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,600
that help claude better understand your

164
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,080
notion workspace and do deep research

165
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,880
over your entire workspace.

166
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
And I think where I've seen the most

167
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,919
excitement and traction with skills is

168
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,479
within large enterprises. These are

169
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,960
company and team specific skills built

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,120
for an organization.

171
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,440
We've been talking to Fortune 100s that

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,280
are using skills as a way to teach

173
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
agents about their organizational best

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,680
practices and the weird and unique ways

175
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
that they use this bespoke internal

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
software.

177
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,280
We're also talking to really large

178
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,680
developer productivity teams. These are

179
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,840
teams serving thousands or even tens of

180
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,120
thousands of developers in an

181
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
organization that are using skills as a

182
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,000
way to deploy agents like cloud code and

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
teach them about code style best

184
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,599
practices and other ways that they want

185
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,479
their developers to work internally.

186
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,840
So all of these different types of

187
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,759
skills are created and consumed by

188
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,120
different people inside of an

189
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,599
organization or in the world. But what

190
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,680
they have in common is anyone can create

191
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
them and they give agents the new

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
capabilities that they didn't have

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,919
before.

194
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
So, as this ecosystem has grown, we've

195
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,319
started to observe a couple of

196
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,880
interesting trends. First, skills are

197
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,440
starting to get more complex. The most

198
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
basic skill today can still be a

199
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,240
skill.md markdown file with some prompts

200
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
and some really basic instructions, but

201
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,759
we're starting to see skills that

202
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,199
package software, executables, binaries,

203
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,680
files, code, scripts, assets, and a lot

204
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,919
more. And a lot of the skills that are

205
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
being built today might take minutes or

206
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,319
hours to build and put into an agent.

207
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,240
But we think that increasingly much like

208
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,160
a lot of the software we use today,

209
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,000
these skills might take weeks or months

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,960
to build and be maintained.

211
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
We're also seeing that this ecosystem of

212
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,639
skills is complementing the existing

213
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,800
ecosystem of MCP servers that was built

214
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,879
up over the course of this year.

215
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
Developers are using and building skills

216
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,680
that orchestrate workflows of multiple

217
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,160
MCP tools stitched together to do more

218
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,240
complex things with external data and

219
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,440
connectivity. And in these cases, MCP

220
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
MCP is providing the connection to the

221
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
outside world while skills are providing

222
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,680
the expertise.

223
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,880
And finally, and I think most excitingly

224
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
for me personally, is we're seeing

225
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,560
skills that are being built by people

226
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,240
that aren't technical. These are people

227
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,880
in functions like finance, recruiting,

228
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,000
accounting, legal, and a lot more. Um,

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,279
and I think this is pretty early

230
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,080
validation of our initial idea that

231
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,640
skills help people that aren't doing

232
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,120
coding work extend these general agents

233
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,800
and they make these agents more

234
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,480
accessible for the day-to-day of what

235
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,279
these people are working on.

236
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,959
So tying this all together, let's talk

237
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,640
about how these all fit into this

238
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,839
emerging architecture of general agents.

239
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,600
First, we think this architecture is

240
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
converging on a couple of things. The

241
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,000
first is this agent loop that helps

242
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,320
manage the the model's internal context

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,480
and manages what tokens are going in and

244
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,720
out. And this is coupled with a runtime

245
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
environment that provides the agent with

246
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,680
a file system and the ability to read

247
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,399
and write code.

248
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
This agent, as many of us have done

249
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,680
throughout this year, can be connected

250
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,240
to MCP servers. And these are tools and

251
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,080
data from the outside world that make

252
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
the the agent more relevant and more

253
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,320
effective.

254
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,560
And now we can give the same agent a

255
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,120
library of hundreds or thousands of

256
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,600
skills that it can decide to pull into

257
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,839
context only at runtime when it's

258
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,959
deciding to work on a particular task.

259
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,360
Today, giving an agent a new capability

260
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
in a new domain might just involve

261
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,360
equipping it with the right set of MCP

262
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,839
servers and the right library of skills.

263
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,320
And this emerging pattern of an agent

264
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,720
with an MCP server and a set of skills

265
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,079
is something that's already helping us

266
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,920
at Enthropic deploy Claude to new

267
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,160
verticals. Just after we launched skills

268
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,399
5 weeks ago, we immediately launched new

269
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,279
offerings in financial services and life

270
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,279
sciences. And each of these came with a

271
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,440
set of MCP servers and a set of skills

272
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,120
that immediately make Claude more

273
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,200
effective for professionals in each of

274
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,440
these domains.

275
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,640
We're also starting to think about some

276
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,240
of the other open questions and areas

277
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,399
that we want to focus on for how skills

278
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,200
evolve in the future as they start to

279
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,120
become more complex. We really want to

280
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,760
support developers, enterprises, and

281
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,000
other skill builders by starting to

282
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
treat skills like we treat software.

283
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
This means exploring testing and

284
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,440
evaluation, better tooling to make sure

285
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
that these agents are loading and

286
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,839
triggering skills at the right time and

287
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,560
for the right task, and tooling to help

288
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,959
measure the output quality of an agent

289
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,240
equipped with the skill to make sure

290
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,320
that's on par with what the agent is

291
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
supposed to be doing.

292
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
We'd also like to focus on versioning.

293
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,399
as a skill evolves and the resulting

294
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,120
agent behavior uh evolves, we want this

295
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,760
to be uh clearly tracked and to have a

296
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,560
clear lineage over time.

297
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,399
And finally, we'd also like to explore

298
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,720
skills that can explicitly depend on and

299
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,519
refer to either other skills, MCP

300
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,600
servers, and dependencies and packages

301
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,920
within the agents environment. We think

302
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,519
that this is going to make agents a lot

303
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,440
more predictable in different runtime

304
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
environments. and the composability of

305
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
multiple skills together will help

306
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,120
agents like Claude elicit even more

307
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,839
complex and relevant behavior from these

308
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,440
agents.

309
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
Overall, these set of things should

310
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
hopefully make skills easier to build

311
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
and easier to integrate into agent

312
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,560
products, even those besides claude.

313
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,959
Finally, a huge part of the value of

314
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,880
skills we think is going to come from

315
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,600
sharing and distribution. Barry and I

316
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
think a lot about the future of

317
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
companies that are deploying these

318
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120
agents at scale. And the vision that

319
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,399
excites us most is one of a collecting

320
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,800
and collective and evolving knowledge

321
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,360
base of capabilities that's curated by

322
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,279
people and agents inside of an

323
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,240
organization. We think skills are a big

324
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,639
step towards this vision. They provide

325
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,800
the procedural knowledge for your agents

326
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,760
to do useful things. And as you interact

327
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,240
with an agent and give it feedback and

328
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,560
more institutional knowledge, it starts

329
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,399
to get better and all of the agents

330
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,639
inside your team and your org get better

331
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,200
as well. And when someone joins your

332
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
team and starts using Claude for the

333
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,800
first time, it already knows what your

334
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,320
team cares about. It knows about your

335
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,160
day-to-day and it knows about how to be

336
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,680
most effective for the work that you're

337
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,880
doing.

338
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,800
And as this grows and this ecosystem

339
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,720
starts to develop even more, this was

340
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
going to this compounding value is going

341
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,079
to extend outside of just your organ

342
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,399
into the broader community. So just like

343
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,079
when someone else across the world

344
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,680
builds an MCP server that makes your

345
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,760
agent more useful, a skill built by

346
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,519
someone else in the community will help

347
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,920
make your own agents more capable,

348
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,320
reliable, and useful as well.

349
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,639
This vision of a evolving knowledge base

350
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,720
gets even more powerful when claw starts

351
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,200
to create these skills. We design skills

352
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
specifically as a concrete steps towards

353
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,920
uh continuous learning.

354
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,839
When you first start using cloud, this

355
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,279
standardized format gives a very

356
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,440
important guarantee. Anything that cloud

357
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,600
writes down can be used efficiently by a

358
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,079
future version of itself. This makes the

359
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,240
learning actually transferable.

360
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,880
As you build up the context skills makes

361
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,360
the concept of memory more tangible.

362
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
They don't capture everything. They

363
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,880
don't capture every type of information.

364
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
Just procedural knowledge that cloud can

365
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,760
use on specific tasks.

366
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,279
When you have worked with cloud for

367
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,600
quite a while, the flexibility of skills

368
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,320
matters even more. Cloud can acquire new

369
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,560
capabilities instantly, evolve them as

370
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,160
needed, and then drop the ones that

371
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
become obsolete. This is what we have

372
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
always known. The power of in in context

373
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,320
learning makes this a lot more cost-

374
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,480
effective for information that change on

375
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,560
daily basis.

376
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,880
Our goal is that claude on day 30 of

377
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,560
working with you is going to be a lot

378
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,880
better on cloud on day one. CL can

379
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,160
already create skills for you today

380
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,639
using our skill creator skill and we're

381
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,839
going to continue pushing in that

382
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,839
direction.

383
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,120
We're going to conclude by comparing the

384
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,360
agent stack to what we have already seen

385
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,880
computing.

386
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,839
In a rough analogy, models are like

387
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,160
processors. Both require massive

388
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,079
investment and contain immense

389
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,240
potential, but only so useful by

390
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
themselves.

391
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,160
Then we start building operating system.

392
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,399
The OS made processors far more valuable

393
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,240
by orchestrating the processes,

394
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,160
resources, and data around the

395
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,639
processor. In AI, we believe that agent

396
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,639
runtime is starting to play this role.

397
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,639
We're all trying to build the cleanest,

398
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,959
most efficient, and most scalable uh

399
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,279
abstractions to get the right tokens in

400
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,680
and out of the model.

401
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
But once we have a platform, the real

402
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,079
value comes from applications. A few

403
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
companies build uh processors and

404
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,639
operating systems, but millions of

405
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,120
developers like us have built software

406
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
that encoded domain expertise and our

407
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,600
unique points of view. We hope that

408
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
skills can help us open up this layer

409
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,320
for everyone. This is where we get

410
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,480
creative and solve concrete problem for

411
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,920
ourselves, for each other, and for the

412
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
world just by putting stuff in the

413
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,920
folder. So skills are just the starting

414
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,480
point.

415
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
To close out, we think we're now

416
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,160
converging on this general architecture

417
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,959
for general agents. We've created skills

418
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,199
as a new paradigm for shipping and

419
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,680
sharing new capabilities. So we think

420
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,839
it's time to stop rebuilding agents and

421
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,920
start building skills instead. And if

422
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,519
you're excited about this, come work

423
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,279
with us and start building some skills

424
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,399
today. Thank you.
