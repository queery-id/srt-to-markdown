You probably already know that Claude Code is by far the best coding agent in the world. It can create entire apps from a simple prompt both front end and backend. It can blow your mind in terms of the design of that app. But what you might not know is you can actually use Claude Code as a general agent. And Anthropic released something really interesting a few weeks ago. they released what is called Claude skills which is just a special type of markdown file which allows you to surround claude code with relevant skills. So if you wished that you had an AI agent that had relevant skills, I believe that this is probably the most important thing that you could be studying right now. And so in this video, we're going to talk about how to set up Claude skills. We're also going to talk about how to use Claude code as a general agent. And we're going to talk about how you need to set up your skill.md file and what folders. And I'm going to show you how to just use AI to create these skills. Let's talk about building a general agent with relevant skills for your business. Whether you're a content creator, business owner, aspiring entrepreneur, we're going to build an agent with relevant skills to you and we're going to use that agent. Let's dive in. Okay. So, we're going to start off by talking about what is a coding agent. You may have heard of lovable and this video is not about lovable. We're not even going to use lovable. I just wanted to make a point real quick. So many people are talking about vibe coding. You can use tools like lovable, replet, vibe code. These are coding agents that you can use to build apps. And whenever I go to lovable and type in uh make a landing landing page about pizza right now, what it's doing is it's spinning up a sandbox which is basically a virtual computer and it's going to run an AI agent or an AI coding agent on the side. Now, it's going to generate a bunch of files within a directory or codebase, and those files are going to make an app. And so, this is an AI coding agent at work building an app. Okay, so it's done. The lovable coding agent took my prompt, make a landing page about pizza. It generated all of the files. This coding agent decided what files it needed to generate. it generated them and then it probably reviewed those files and then it ran the program in a virtual computer somewhere so I can see it on my uh browser because this is within a web browser and so this is an example of an agent made specifically for creating simple applications a very narrow agent experience where it's made specifically for creating certain types of apps with certain stacks and we could do this same thing on our computer, right? We could do the same thing on our computer. If we were to go to Finder, we can just go straight into our downloads, right? We can go straight into our downloads and we could go new folder. We can go like this. We can say using quad code, right? So, we don't even need any IDE or something like cursor or lovable. I can open a terminal window. I can open a new terminal at this folder and we can just run claude. So now we're running claude code in this empty folder called using claude code which is an empty folder and I can just say please build a beautiful amazing landing page for my pizza shop Riley's Pizza Shop. Make it in the style of neo brutalism mixed with a friendly pizza energy. So just like lovable, we can run this and claude code in this empty folder is going to create the application right here. Okay, check this out. It just generated an index.html file. And there we go. It created a file the same way that Lovable is creating all the different files and putting them in a folder in some virtual machine. It's just a virtual computer. We're doing this on our computer. It's doing the same exact thing Lovable is doing. And the point I want to make here, you can just use these coding models on your computer and coding files, right? This is an HTML file and this is a CSS file. This is not the only type of file you can create with cloud code. You can create any type of file. So it is done. And if we just copy this link right here and we paste in localhost80, we can run this on our computer. This is running locally on our computer. where Lovable in Lovable's case, it just created a virtual machine and it ran it on that computer and it showed you what it created on the browser. Now, we're running this fully on our computer and we didn't use any like software in between. We generated the code files with an AI coding agent on our computer. It used an AI model from anthropic servers to create those files. So that's where it costs money, but we didn't use any other software other than getting Claude to generate all the files. And we're running it on our MacBook Pro. And this is the website that it created. And you'll notice that in my opinion, I've tested every single one of these coding agents. Just raw Claude code is the best in the world. So Replet and lovable, they have their own coding agents. Claude Code out of the box is better than all of them. And so what I want to explain now is how you can use this as a general agent. So this right here is Obsidian. And this is just a basic notes app where every file instead of the files uh being an HTML file or a JavaScript file or a CSS file which ultimately created this uh application that we can use. Instead of it being one of those types of files, these are all markdown files. So the way that I use general agents is I actually use claude code at the same location as my notes like this is my agent workspace. This is kind of how I think about this. This is a notebook and Riley Brown uses this as his personal notebook so that he can be a better CMO and co-founder of the Vibe Code app. And I basically state all of my goals. Why am I stating this? I I know my goals. Why am I writing this? because I don't use this by myself. I use this with my general agent which is Claude Code. And what I can do here is I can actually click on this or I can rightclick on this and hit reveal in Finder. So here we can see Riley content creation. That's basically what I called this file. And you'll see here all of these different files here. Um like this is just a wrapper of these files that are showing up on my computer, right? This is just in my computer. And so the same way that I ran claude code in a new folder, I can run claude code in this folder. So I can reveal this in finder. What I'm going to do is I'm going to rightclick services, new terminal at folder, right? New terminal at folder. Now you can see here that it is running. So we're in this folder right here, which is the same folder where all of this is located. And now we can run uh claude. And so now we have cloud code running in the folder that has all of my notes. And so I can use it with cloud code. So I could go into tasks, right? And and this is how I keep track of my tasks. I could go into Q. Um let's say these are both done, right? This is these are the things that I want to do. Um and so in my queue, one thing that I do want to do, and I can just drag this in here. One thing that I do want to do is I want to explain Claude skills to my audience and make a video. Right? This is one thing I really want to do. Um I want to um share the file structure um with of Claude skills. And then I want to take my notebook and examine what Claude skills would be useful for me to create. And I'm I'm uh do this on this page. Don't create or edit any other files. Just make a plan and do it. Okay. So, we just created this markdown file of this thing that I want to do. The cool thing is I can just ask Claude Code to do it. I can just say, "Do what's in my queue." Right? That's all I need to say. I can say, "Yo, do what's in my queue." And because the first thing that this agent's going to do is analyze the readme file. It's going to see how it's organized, right? It's going to know that there's tasks. It's going to know what the queue is, draft tasks. So, it's just going to know to check the queue. And because Claude Code is such a powerful agent and it's really good at looking through the code base, in this case, which is just a bunch of my notes, it's going to find the right location. It's really smart. And it's going to find this page, and it's just going to do what I want it to do. And we'll just wait for Cloud Code to do that. And you'll see here that we never said to look at this file. It doesn't know that I have this file open. It just found what's in my queue. And you can see here it's examining notebook for skill ideas. It found the right file and now it's creating the relevant things. Allow it to edit this session. Boom. Look at that. So, it just added all of this. It added all of this to this document. It told us what skills are, right? And it told us that uh from the anthropic skills repo, it it basically did research. It found uh the clawed skills repo. And now it is telling us that you can create within the claude.md file. You can create a skill by creating a folder with the skill name. And inside that folder, it needs to have a claude or a skill.md file. And then you can put optional uh resources within that folder. And so you can even put assets, references, etc. And I'll get to that in just a second. The point I wanted to make is the same way lovable was a coding specific example of using an agent. This is a notes specific example for using an agent. So I promise you we are we're working our way up to creating claude skills. I just wanted to illustrate the point. I wanted to talk about what a domain specific agent was like the lovable agent that can create apps. Then I showed you a note takingaking example where you can use claude code as a general agent. Now, we're going to use it in a wide openen world within cursor. And we can do literally whatever we want. I like to use cursor because it's just the best in my opinion for quickly using claude code. And it's ironic because I use we can just say claude code skills. So, what uh we're going to be creating claude skills in this project. So, I'll just name it that. And now it is opening up this directory in an IDE. So cloud uh a cursor is just an IDE like VS Code where you can view all the files. And so the way that I vibe code is I'm just going to come in here and the first thing that I'm going to do is hit command J. We're going to open up the terminal and we're going to type claude. Then we're going to press this right here to open up the side panel. And so now we have Claude code on the left or on the right. controlling this directory which is claude code skills and what we're going to do here is I'm going to say please take a look at this direct or at this repo and I'm going to paste this GitHub uh to the anthropic skills right here please create one simple skill in the right format so that you will use this skill when you need to. Okay. So, right now it's creating an example skill. What it's going to do is it's going to create a cloud file. It's going to create a cloud file. As you can see here, it's created this.cloud file. It's also going to create a skills folder as you'll see in just a second. Okay, there you go. It created a folder called.cloud and then it created a skills folder within that. And then it has other folders beneath it. So it created this summarized folder with a skill MD. That's all you need to create a skill. You just need to put in the docloud folder because cloud code knows to look in thecloud folder for certain things like sub aents and now skills. We're not talking about sub aents in this video. We're just talking about skills. So we created the skills folder. And within this folder, right, we see this skill.md. And every single skill.mmd file should be formatted with the name and description. Right? It should have a name and description. You can see here that this one that I've created is called brand voice, which is skill number one. And then there is a name and description. And so the name is just a human-friendly title. It can be anything. But the crucial part is this description because it tells Claude code when to use this skill. And so we're reaching a point where you can get agents to do things with a simple markdown file. But what you need to do is you need to make sure that you format it correctly so Cloud Code knows when to follow your instructions. Because basically all skills are the way that I think about them is they are just SOPs or standard operating procedures. SOPs for agents. And so right these are instructions on what to do in certain scenarios. And if you put a high quality description, it'll know what instruction manual or SOP to use when it needs to do a specific task. And so I don't really want to use this summarize skill. I actually want to create a skill that's much more relevant to me. Okay. So I just want to show you what I've been doing. I've been annotating. I've been annotating my Twitter posts because I can give these to Claude. I can put these in Claude skills so that the agent knows how I post. And so I can say short video attached to this photo. This is a Twitter account that I run by the way that helps me grow Vibe Code. And I can say um uh senior vibe coder is ragebait and works. I don't do this often, right? Okay. And I just put this directly on the image. And it helps me kind of annotate my images here. And I'm just going to hit I'm just going to exit out. Hit save. And we can save all these. And so what we can do here is we can just take all of these files. We can drag them in here. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to put a new skill here. And what we can do is we can just drag these images in here. Now we're going to go to cloud code. I want you to replace this uh summarize skill. And because this is a folder, right? Uh I can just type at summarize, right? I can say replace this summarize skill. Uh this skill, the whole summarize skill uh should be replaced with a Twitter post X post skill. This skill should allow the agent to create tweets in my style and use the images that are in the at new in the new skill here folder as a reference. So please create that skill now. So we're basically going to tell cloud code to analyze these images. It's going to look for patterns in how I speak. And actually one thing I can mention, I just hit the backspace. Just know the red text in these images are annotations. So that's not part of the post. These are my annotations to you on why I did certain things. So take that into consideration when constructing this skill, right? So I annotated why I did what I did. So this gives some extra context to Cloud Code and it's going to packages it package it as a skill. And so in theory whenever I ask for a Twitter post to claude code in the future uh within this repo it should be able to do it in my style because I've given it relevant context. Okay. So there you go. It created this skill.md file and all it did was analyze all of those images. It converted them into these uh markdown formats and it converted it into a skill. What it didn't do is I didn't specify this. Uh that was just a temporary folder. Please remove that folder, but add those images into that skill folder as references because this doesn't need to be here. This can just go into the skill and right. So right now we have two skills. We're going to add another skill in just a second. So we have one skill and every skill needs a claw.md file. So it just created this and now it has these references that it can use right here. What we can do if we want references uh to posts and we can select all of these and we can just like move them in here. So we have references and then the skill.md file. You need this skill.md file, right? And so what we can do, I want you to create a markdown file in the root. And when I say in the root, I mean right there's the the folder that we opened up originally which is claude code skills. This is the root folder. So it should put it in below thecloud folder. The dotcloud folder is also in the root. The skills folder is in the do.cloud folder. Thus not in the root. Just wanted to be clear. uh in the root and come up with 10 ideas for the Twitter copy based on my last video where I explained Claude skills should match and then I can uh give it that GitHub repo link I mentioned skills and explained why it's important. important for general use cases for like marketing and as general agent. Okay. So, let's say I made this video because I'm making this video right now. What I would probably do is feed in the transcript of this video and then it would generate 10 options. So, it would have more context of the video we're creating. But since I'm making the video right now, I can't give it the transcript. Um, but that's okay. It's going to create a markdown file in the root and it's going to use this skill. Okay, so it is done. Okay, you'll see that when you see this green dot and it shows expost right here. When you see this green dot and it has expost, that means it's using that skill, right? It is using the expost skill. And we're going to allow it to create these files. And boom, Twitter ideas. So, here we go. Cloud Code just became a general agent, not a chatbot, an agent that does your workflows. Enthropic just released skills, reusable prompt templates, invoke with slash commands, marketing teams. Okay, so this is really good. Oh my, this shouldn't be possible. I turned Claude into my personal marketing team. Social media copy on demand, email sequences in seconds, brand voice locked in permanently. Zero prompting every time. How Claude skills one markdown file infinite workflows. This is very good. So it wrote this in my voice using this skill. But it gets much cooler than this. So if we were to go to um let's go to arc. So we're going to go to typefully.com. And in typefully we can go to settings and we could go to API and we can hit new API key. And so this is going to be test key for me. Create API key. I'm going to delete this right after this video. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on this docs. And this explains exactly how to use this API key. So, what I'm trying to do here is I don't want it to just come up with ideas. I want them to draft them in this tool where I can post directly to social media. So, in theory, I could have an agent uh come up with tweets uh and automatically draft them within Titefully because that's what you can do here on this platform, right? We could have it directly post this as a um a draft here, right? It can schedule a new draft. And so, that's exactly what I'm going to tell it. So I want you to add to our x post skill. I'm using the software typley and I want you to instead of basically instead of putting these in a document, I want you to actually directly schedule these as a draft on tightfully. And so I am going to give it these docs to the API. Here are the docs to read. Here is my API key. It is in a text file, right? So I don't want to expose it. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to go I'm going to go key.txt txt. I'm going to paste my key right here. So, I pasted my key in this file and I can just go at key.txt. It is here. Please add to the skill using claude skills. And I'm going to mention this link right here. Please make this skill such that it schedules it as a draft to this typefully account. It should not post or schedule. Okay, now we're going to wait for the skill called expost to be uh messed with. Okay, so it is done. And here we can see that your accounts available is Riley Brown vibe code vibe coding explained. Okay, so this works. Maybe maybe uh please test this by um drafting one of the items in the list that we generated in and then we can just go claude skills Twitter ideas. Okay. Okay. It looks like it is done. If we come back here. Okay. It created this, right? It created this on vibe coding explained. Okay. Now on the Riley Brown account, draft a post that says, "Hi, this is a test." Okay, so it's done. If we go back to Arc, we go to Riley. Here we go. We see, "Hi, this is a test. This was 34 seconds ago." So that's pretty cool. We can have it draft posts. I'm going to just reset the context here. Um, so we're opening up a new cloud instance to reset it, right? We're resetting it uh so that there's no context in here. And I'm going to say, I just created a tightfully video that explains how I created a Claude code skill in order to uh post on all my Twitter accounts via Typefully. I want you to draft up three exposts and draft them on Typefully on the Vibe Coding Explained account. Oops, I misspelled it. Typefully is the app. Okay, so we interrupted it, but it was using the Expost skill. It should go back to using the Expost skill. Okay, do I want to proceed? Yes. Okay, so the drafts were created. Oo, it has a link associated with it. Wait, what happens if we just go to this link? Wow, skills repo. It even included that repo. No way. You can build custom skills for cloud code, automate repetitive workflows, create one-click commands, share skills across projects. Zero coding required. Just dropped a full walkth through how to do this. Wow. Okay, so it created these posts using the typefully or the expost skill and in this skill.md file, it has access to this code, right? You can it has this code that I can that the claude code can use to post this on social media. And what I need to do now is I need to delete my API key because I probably exposed it. All right, so there you go. We just created a general agent and we gave it a skill. And you know what? I think that's enough for you to get started. I don't want to like go crazy and create like an agent swarm or an agent with a ton of different skills, but we just created a we used claude within cursor to create an agent. And then we just created one simple skill. And this is enough for you to get started because as you saw, I just gave it the link which I'll put in the description to the Claude code skills. So claude code can make your skills for you and remember you just create you know you have the root folder right and then within your project you just have aclad pro uh folder then you have another folder uh which is your skills folder and then within that you just have the skill name. So this is just skill uh skill-1 folder and then in here you have a uh a skill md file and within that file it will have a name and description and cloud code will do that for you. Just make sure that when you create these skills right because you can create many of these. You can create skill one which we did um and we didn't create more than one skill right you can create as many skills as you want. I wouldn't go overboard, but if you want to create a general purpose agent and use Cloud Code, this is how you can do it. And you can create a bunch of different skills. And so, in the description down below this video, you'll find a link to a webinar. I'm just going to do like a big live stream where we're going to create a really cool uh agent interface with a ton of different skills. We're going to do it live. It's going to be like 3 to four hours long. And so, if you want to sign up for that, that's in the description. It's going to be sick. But uh yeah, this is just part two of my general agent series. I made part one on Obsidian and I'm just going to continue this because I'm becoming much more interested in creating agents with skills. And in the future, we're going to mix agent skills with also apps. We're going to create a little interface where we can alternate between using an app that we create and the agent and we can create things that both me and the agent can use. It's going to be like an agent interface or an agent workspace. And that's what we're going to talk about in the next video. Uh so thank you guys for watching.

#### Transcript

[music] All right, good morning and thank you for having us again. Last time we were here, we're still figuring out what an agent even is. Today, many of us are using agents on a daily basis. But we still notice gaps. We still have slots, right? Agents have intelligence and capabilities, but not always expertise that we need for real work. I'm Barry. This is Mahes. We created agent skills. In this talk, we'll show you why we stopped building agents and started building skills instead. A lot of things have changed since our last talk. MCP became the standard for agent connectivity. Cloud Code, our first coding agent, launched to the world and our cloud agent SDK now provides a production ready agent out of the box. We have a more mature ecosystem and we're moving towards a new paradigm for agents. That paradigm is a tighter coupling between the model and a runtime environment. Put simply, we think code is all we need. We used to think agents in different domains will look very different. Each one will need its own tools and scaffolding and that means we'll have a separate agent for each use case for each domain. Well, customization is still important for each domain. The agent underneath is actually more universal than we thought. What we realized is that code is not just a use case but the universal interface to the digital world. After we built cloud code, we realized that cloud code is actually a general purpose agent. Think about generating a financial report. The model can call the API to pull in data and do research. It can organize that data in the file system. It can analyze it with Python and then synthesize the insight in old file format all through code. The core scaffolding can suddenly become as thin as just bash and file system which is great and really scalable. But we very quickly run into a different problem and that problem is domain expertise. Who do you want doing your taxes? Is it going to be Mahesh, the 300 IQ mathematical genius, or is it Barry, an experienced tax professional, right? I would pick Barry every time. I don't want Mahesh to figure out the 2025 tax code from first principles. I need consistent execution from from a domain expert. As agents today are a lot like Mahes. They're brilliant, but they lack expertise. They can do no more slow. They can do amazing things when you really put in the effort and give proper guidance, but they're often missing the important context up front. They can't really absorb your expertise super well, and they don't learn over time. That's why we created agent skills. Skills are organized collections of files that package composable procedural knowledge for agents. In other words, they're folders. This simplicity is deliberate. We want something that anyone human or agent can create and use as long as they have a computer. These also work with what you already have. You can version them in Git, you can throw them in Google Drive and you can zip them up and share with your team. We have used files for uh as a primitive for decades and we like them. So why change now? Because of that skills can also include a lot of scripts as tools. Traditional tools have pretty obvious problems. Some tools have poorly written instructions and are pretty ambiguous and when the model is struggling, it can't really make a change to the tool. So, it's just kind of stuck with a code start problem and they always live in the context window. Code solves some of these issues. It's self-documenting. It is modifiable and can live in the file system until they're really needed and used. Here's an example of a script inside of a skill. We kept seeing Claude write the same Python script over and over again to apply styling to slides. So we just ask cloud to save it inside of the skill as a tool for his version for his future self. Now we can just run the script and that makes everything a lot more consistent and a lot more efficient. At this point skills can contain a lot of information and we want to protect the context window so that we can fit in hundreds of skills and make them truly composable. That's why skills are progressively disclosed. At runtime, only this metadata is shown to the model just to indicate that he has the skill. When an agent needs to use a skill, it can read in the rest of the skill.md, which contains the core instruction and directory for the rest of the folder. Everything else is just organized for ease of access. So that's all skills are. They're organized folders with scripts as tools. Since our launch five weeks ago, this very simple design has translated into a very quickly growing ecosystem of thousands of skills. And we've seen this be split across a couple of different types of skills. There are foundational skills, third party skills created by partners in the ecosystem, and skills built within an enterprise and within teams. To start, foundational skills are those that give agents new general capabilities or domain specific capabilities that it didn't have before. We ourselves with our launch built document skills that give Claude the ability to create and edit professional quality office documents. We're also really excited to see people like Cadence build scientific research skills that give Claude new capabilities like EHR data analysis and using common Python bioinformatics libraries better than it could before. We've also seen partners in the ecosystem build skills that help Claude better with their own software and their own products. Browserbase is a pretty good example of this. They built a skill for their open- source browser automation tooling, stage hand. And now Claude equipped that this skill and with stage hand can now go navigate the web and use a browser more effectively to get work done. And notion launched a bunch of skills that help claude better understand your notion workspace and do deep research over your entire workspace. And I think where I've seen the most excitement and traction with skills is within large enterprises. These are company and team specific skills built for an organization. We've been talking to Fortune 100s that are using skills as a way to teach agents about their organizational best practices and the weird and unique ways that they use this bespoke internal software. We're also talking to really large developer productivity teams. These are teams serving thousands or even tens of thousands of developers in an organization that are using skills as a way to deploy agents like cloud code and teach them about code style best practices and other ways that they want their developers to work internally. So all of these different types of skills are created and consumed by different people inside of an organization or in the world. But what they have in common is anyone can create them and they give agents the new capabilities that they didn't have before. So, as this ecosystem has grown, we've started to observe a couple of interesting trends. First, skills are starting to get more complex. The most basic skill today can still be a skill.md markdown file with some prompts and some really basic instructions, but we're starting to see skills that package software, executables, binaries, files, code, scripts, assets, and a lot more. And a lot of the skills that are being built today might take minutes or hours to build and put into an agent. But we think that increasingly much like a lot of the software we use today, these skills might take weeks or months to build and be maintained. We're also seeing that this ecosystem of skills is complementing the existing ecosystem of MCP servers that was built up over the course of this year. Developers are using and building skills that orchestrate workflows of multiple MCP tools stitched together to do more complex things with external data and connectivity. And in these cases, MCP MCP is providing the connection to the outside world while skills are providing the expertise. And finally, and I think most excitingly for me personally, is we're seeing skills that are being built by people that aren't technical. These are people in functions like finance, recruiting, accounting, legal, and a lot more. Um, and I think this is pretty early validation of our initial idea that skills help people that aren't doing coding work extend these general agents and they make these agents more accessible for the day-to-day of what these people are working on. So tying this all together, let's talk about how these all fit into this emerging architecture of general agents. First, we think this architecture is converging on a couple of things. The first is this agent loop that helps manage the the model's internal context and manages what tokens are going in and out. And this is coupled with a runtime environment that provides the agent with a file system and the ability to read and write code. This agent, as many of us have done throughout this year, can be connected to MCP servers. And these are tools and data from the outside world that make the the agent more relevant and more effective. And now we can give the same agent a library of hundreds or thousands of skills that it can decide to pull into context only at runtime when it's deciding to work on a particular task. Today, giving an agent a new capability in a new domain might just involve equipping it with the right set of MCP servers and the right library of skills. And this emerging pattern of an agent with an MCP server and a set of skills is something that's already helping us at Enthropic deploy Claude to new verticals. Just after we launched skills 5 weeks ago, we immediately launched new offerings in financial services and life sciences. And each of these came with a set of MCP servers and a set of skills that immediately make Claude more effective for professionals in each of these domains. We're also starting to think about some of the other open questions and areas that we want to focus on for how skills evolve in the future as they start to become more complex. We really want to support developers, enterprises, and other skill builders by starting to treat skills like we treat software. This means exploring testing and evaluation, better tooling to make sure that these agents are loading and triggering skills at the right time and for the right task, and tooling to help measure the output quality of an agent equipped with the skill to make sure that's on par with what the agent is supposed to be doing. We'd also like to focus on versioning. as a skill evolves and the resulting agent behavior uh evolves, we want this to be uh clearly tracked and to have a clear lineage over time. And finally, we'd also like to explore skills that can explicitly depend on and refer to either other skills, MCP servers, and dependencies and packages within the agents environment. We think that this is going to make agents a lot more predictable in different runtime environments. and the composability of multiple skills together will help agents like Claude elicit even more complex and relevant behavior from these agents. Overall, these set of things should hopefully make skills easier to build and easier to integrate into agent products, even those besides claude. Finally, a huge part of the value of skills we think is going to come from sharing and distribution. Barry and I think a lot about the future of companies that are deploying these agents at scale. And the vision that excites us most is one of a collecting and collective and evolving knowledge base of capabilities that's curated by people and agents inside of an organization. We think skills are a big step towards this vision. They provide the procedural knowledge for your agents to do useful things. And as you interact with an agent and give it feedback and more institutional knowledge, it starts to get better and all of the agents inside your team and your org get better as well. And when someone joins your team and starts using Claude for the first time, it already knows what your team cares about. It knows about your day-to-day and it knows about how to be most effective for the work that you're doing. And as this grows and this ecosystem starts to develop even more, this was going to this compounding value is going to extend outside of just your organ into the broader community. So just like when someone else across the world builds an MCP server that makes your agent more useful, a skill built by someone else in the community will help make your own agents more capable, reliable, and useful as well. This vision of a evolving knowledge base gets even more powerful when claw starts to create these skills. We design skills specifically as a concrete steps towards uh continuous learning. When you first start using cloud, this standardized format gives a very important guarantee. Anything that cloud writes down can be used efficiently by a future version of itself. This makes the learning actually transferable. As you build up the context skills makes the concept of memory more tangible. They don't capture everything. They don't capture every type of information. Just procedural knowledge that cloud can use on specific tasks. When you have worked with cloud for quite a while, the flexibility of skills matters even more. Cloud can acquire new capabilities instantly, evolve them as needed, and then drop the ones that become obsolete. This is what we have always known. The power of in in context learning makes this a lot more cost- effective for information that change on daily basis. Our goal is that claude on day 30 of working with you is going to be a lot better on cloud on day one. CL can already create skills for you today using our skill creator skill and we're going to continue pushing in that direction. We're going to conclude by comparing the agent stack to what we have already seen computing. In a rough analogy, models are like processors. Both require massive investment and contain immense potential, but only so useful by themselves. Then we start building operating system. The OS made processors far more valuable by orchestrating the processes, resources, and data around the processor. In AI, we believe that agent runtime is starting to play this role. We're all trying to build the cleanest, most efficient, and most scalable uh abstractions to get the right tokens in and out of the model. But once we have a platform, the real value comes from applications. A few companies build uh processors and operating systems, but millions of developers like us have built software that encoded domain expertise and our unique points of view. We hope that skills can help us open up this layer for everyone. This is where we get creative and solve concrete problem for ourselves, for each other, and for the world just by putting stuff in the folder. So skills are just the starting point. To close out, we think we're now converging on this general architecture for general agents. We've created skills as a new paradigm for shipping and sharing new capabilities. So we think it's time to stop rebuilding agents and start building skills instead. And if you're excited about this, come work with us and start building some skills today. Thank you.

#### Transcript

I use clot more than any other AI but even I dismiss Clark as just for developers and I was wrong after using myself I am completely so and this is too powerful to ignore if you want to use AI to build system and do work for you end to end not just chatting and copy pasting so in this video I'll share how to get started with cloud code even if you don't use for coding and most importantly how to use it to build an AI work team and system that you can actually use. Let's go. So why claw code is even needed if claw is already so powerful. So most people use cloud projects with custom instructions to turn claw into AI agents. But they are silo. You end up copy and pasting between them. You are the coordinator. But with cloud code is different. So these cloud agents share the same workspace access to the same context file. They can talk to each other and hands up work automatically each with their own token context window and claude now becomes the team lead. You give the direction they execute together and that is what we are building today. So each of these cloud code agents you create needs at least three core components all defined in one single markdown file. the role and responsibilities, the knowledge like workflow details, reusable clot agent skills, the MCP tools that they have access to. For this demo, we'll be building a five agent work and claude, our main agent will add as our team lead to coordinate between these agent. A bonus tip is when designing your AI teammate, give them specific and non-over overlapping roles to minimize the potential conflicts. Now, to get started with clark code, there are four main ways to access it. First, the local terminal. This is the raw method and will give you the best experience. Luckily, Anthroporic just launched a native installer. So, which makes it really easy to install. I'll put the official link below. And second, ID extension. So, you can add CL code to ID like VS Code or Kursa and let you run the CL code and see the project file structure side by side. Third, the cloud web app where you can click the code tab and run the CL code in the cloud, but it requires you linking to a GitHub repository. and fourth, cloud desktop app which has cloud code built-in and this is what we'll be using today. Now, whatever way you choose, I still highly recommend installing cloud code through the terminal first because the terminal gives you the most complete experience. All commands and features work fully since we're running Clark locally. So, the first thing is to set up a local project folder. So, think of it like a dedicated workspace for Clark. So, let's say I run a marketing agency and I'm setting up the TIM system. So let's create a folder called marketing team and then I highly recommend to include all useful business context about this agency brand. Then access code using whatever method that you choose. So for our case we will use cloud desktop application. So navigate to Clark pick local as the environment and then pick the folder we just create. Now before we even create any agents the very first step is to initiate this project by creating a cloth.md file. So this is just like a project system prompt. It gives all the important context to cla about what it should know. So ask claw to read the business context file and create a cloth.md file and to build the necessary folder structure. So immediately cloth has created all the folders for this agency brand. And we can even open up an ID to doublech checkck all the folders and the cloth empty file. All right. Now let's build our first teammate the content strategies. So this is the simplest version. No clock scales, no MCP tools, just the basic context file. A key features of clock code is the slash command. So you can type slash to trigger these built-in shortcuts. And there are lots of them and most of them are really for coding purpose. So I won't go through them one by one today. But for agent creation, we need the CLI terminal because the Asian commands is not fully supported in a chat interface yet. So first type claw just to initiate a session. So this way you can trigger the terminal and don't be scared. Basically this is just a raw sections for cloud code and a chat interface is just like a wpper. Now type / agents to trigger the building cloth agent configuration. Then select create new agent. Pick project level agent as this agents is for this project only. Then pick generate with clot. So here you can describe what this agent will do. So in our case, this is a content strategist agent that will do web search and prepare content research documents in MD files. Then select the tools default clock model color for this agent to use. And now we're done. We have create our first clot agents for this work team. And whenever you want to call this agent, just tag this agent name in any cloud code session. So we can double check using the VS code IDE and you will see from the folder it has created the agent under the agents folder. So basically it's just an empty file containing the system prompt defining the role and the capabilities for this agent and you can always change it since this agent will also use different strategy templates. We can also ask it to create all the necessary templates that this agent will use. And this is the power of CL code because it not only created files for you but also put it in the right folder according to this team system structure. So no more copy and paste. Immediately these templates have been created under the template folder like the campaign plan content brief content strategy template. So they are really detailed and this is fantastic. Now to use this agent in a chat interface just tag this agent or just use plain language to specify the agent name and ask it to research the latest SEO challenges and prepare a content brief. So you will see it will trigger different web searches and also reading the content brief template file that it just create and then after a few minutes the content brief is ready and this is super comprehensive and the agent has followed everything stated in the template. So do not just create an agent. Always give it context, templates, resource, standard rules to follow. So it will always produce quality output like this. Now that you have seen how easy it is to build content agents with AI, here is the catch. Consumers have strong opinions about AI generated content. If you want to understand what they actually think and how to implement AI without losing their trust, this free report from HubSpot and Survey Monkey, how brands are earning loyalty in an automated world covers exactly that in detail. You can find the link below based on the data from over 15,000 consumers globally. Only 24% of consumers actually like seeing AI in their emails, ads, or customer support. And 84% want to know when brands are using AI. That is a trust gap you need to close. And what I also found valuable is a section about operational best practices for staying authentic with AI. It gives you five actionable strategies to implement AI without losing the human connection. Download this for free in the description. And thank you HubSpot and Survey Monkey for sponsoring this video. All right, let's create our second agent, a presentation specialist. And this time, let's also add clock agent skills. So skills are just like a reusable instruction manual that tells claw how to execute your task and particularly for this agent we'll use the official document creation skills. So enthrop provide a list of official skills but they are not pre-built inside clock. So you can go to this official skills GitHub repository and the easiest and reliable way is to use the building plug-in command inside clock. So type /plugin and register the official skill repository and then install the document skills and also I recommend to install the example skills to enable all other official skills as well. Then we can use this prompt to double confirm these skills are successfully made available inside cloud code. Now again use the embedded terminal inside cloud desktop and use the agent configuration mode to create these presentation specialist agent. This agent will transform all the data into pawn slide decks. Note I also specify the brand color palettes here. So this agent will always follow these color tone when generating the slides. Then quickly we have our second agent builds. So let's say we have this performing data set inside this data folder. Then we can just tag this agent name and then ask it to create a presentation deck for this file under our folder. And if you're using the terminal, you can just simply tag the file path which will be much easier. Now it triggers the document creation skills that we have in store and out of film it create a performance report presentation for us with 10 slides. So it is quite decent and is using the color scheme that we have defined with the color box charts graphs for storytelling. Although it's not using very sophisticated graphics, it's definitely ready to present and with minimal adjustment. And so perhaps maybe you have different data sets, documents, reports. You don't even need to upload them. You can just put them inside a folder and then let claw to scan and load them and call this agent to build the deck for you. All right, our third agent which is a data analyst. So this time we'll be adding MCP tools. So MCP less clock connect to external system and retrieve live data or context and this is where your AI team become truly powerful. So first we need to install all the necessary MCB server and make them available on cloud code. So if you have been using cloud desktop you probably already have a list of MCB servers connected. So the easiest way is to input them through the local terminal. So we need to use the computer's local terminal is because the embedded one in the clock desktop does not support this import command. So open the terminal application. So navigate to our project folder path using this cd command. Then use this command mcp at from clot desktop to import the mcp servers that you want. So in this case I have import three mcp servers. Notion hrefs j4. notes depending on the MCP server that you install some of them might require further authentication before you can use them on cloud code and to confirm it's already installed go back to cloud desktop open the terminal type /mcp and we can see all the three MCP servers are available now repeat the same process to build this data analyst agent with the agent command so this agent will connect to J4 through the MCP tool and create parnish interactive HTML dashboard and again we will use the same brand color palettes to keep everything on brand and then now we have three agents in a team. So let's test this agent to analyze our website performance and build a dashboard. So it's now calling the J4 MCB server to retrieve the data and quickly it has built us a dashboard with the photo path. So it is in the same brand color we have specified with the executive summary, key metrics boxes, interactive charts, trend lines and this is what club really excels at about strategic storytelling and insights. Then we can even export this directly as a PDF file which is ready to send out to the team for quick sharing. Now let's level up further. So we'll create custom skills that make our agents even more brand specific. And then we'll build a fourth agent, a social media specialist who will use these custom skills. So let's create a custom skills called branded social visuals which will be used for creating branded social graphics. So upload some visual example for cloth and then ask it to read the official canvas design skills and extend it for visual creations with the specified brand color layout style for this agency brand. So now it triggers the official skills creator we have enabled and studies the canvas design skills and then extends it and create a new custom skills following the official structure. And from the ID explorer we can also see a new skill MD file is generated. And so using this same method, we can create a few more custom skills perhaps like a keyword research skills that we call the HF's MCP and LLM optimized the blog writer skills that generate AI search friendly blog and a custom brand voice skills. So if you want to learn how to build these custom skills, go check out this video. So let's see this in action with the social media specialist agent which will use this custom skills and a notion MCP. So we can give it some topic ideas and ask it to drop the post copy with visuals and schedule them on our notion calendar. So it is now calling the branded social visual skill we just create for visual creation and then calls the notion MCP to upload all the post details to our calendar. And now all the visuals have been created under this folder. Although these visuals are not that fancy, it's also not cloth strain, but definitely you can see everything is on brand using the brand color pallets and with the brand test logo. So these workflow automation is 100% working. And you can always let claw use all the image generation model perhaps Gemini Nano Banana for more stunning visual images. And claw also successfully schedule all these posts on the notion content calendar following our posting schedule with the platform details, posting status, postcopy, hashtag. So this is what make clock so powerful. Everything can be done like in 30 minutes. Now we have built our AI team. Four agents you have seen plus an SEO content specialist I created the same way. So here comes the most exciting part is watching them working together. But before we do that, Clot needs to know when and who to delegate it to. So remember the clock empty file we created in the very first step. So the key here is to ask claw to review all the agents in this workspace and then update that clock.md file with the agent routing rules. So these are the instructions that tell claw which agent to call for different tasks and what are the trigger phrase and this is an important step to make the whole system work. So now it has add these routing rules that define when it should delegate to this agent and it even add a section for the multi- aent workflow which is amazing and let's test it with a multi- aent workflow. So we will ask it to do content research about a content topic and then create a blog post and also a presentation deck based on this content research findings. And that means both the blog writing and presentation task will depend on the first task of content research. So you can see it start with the first task and cause the content strategist agent to do the research through the web search. So once the task has been complete, it now move on to the next task for the blog post creation and dedicate to our SEO content specialist and the agent now triggers the keyword research skills that cause the HFS MCP and then it also triggers the block writing and document skills for the actual blog content creation. Now it move on to the client presentation task and calls the presentation agent which will use the PowerPoint creation skills. So all the tasks have been done and claw is just like your team lead give you the summary for all the deliverables and the agents that it use. So first the content brief about the topic backed by research that is really detailed and follows the predefined format which is a great starting point and then the blog post is pretty impressive as well. So following all the required formats to make it AI search friendly, use of bullet points, FAQ sections and I particularly like this section about the 10 common pricing mistake which is great for AI search engines and what is amazing is I can see this blog is following the content brief done by the other agent the content structure talking points and has almost 5,000 words and you can further enhance it perhaps also like claw to upload for you to your final CMS platform and if you want any of your blog documents to match your branding and formatting. You can always create custom branded skills that use your branded template like how we did just now. And for the deck is also using our branded theme. So everything is on brand and the content is also using the same content research findings. So basically all the deliverables are coherent and aligned to deliver the same story and this is the true AI orchestration in action. And now we have different Asians to achieve a big task and execute agentic workflows like this. All right, there are still so many possibilities and use cases with Plco. If there are any other topics I should cover more, let me know in the comments. And if you enjoy this video, please also give me a thumbs up. I also invite you to join our community. Every month we have deep dive workshop and you will unlock all the prom resources I share on this channel, including this one. I hope to see you there. And before you go, also watch this video about clock skills and learn how to apply them in designing your clock agents and system. I will see you next time.
