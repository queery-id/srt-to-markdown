1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,600
You probably already know that Claude

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,319
Code is by far the best coding agent in

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,640
the world. It can create entire apps

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,880
from a simple prompt both front end and

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,120
backend. It can blow your mind in terms

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,679
of the design of that app. But what you

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,519
might not know is you can actually use

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,160
Claude Code as a general agent. And

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,160
Anthropic released something really

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,920
interesting a few weeks ago. they

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,119
released what is called Claude skills

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,359
which is just a special type of markdown

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,119
file which allows you to surround claude

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,640
code with relevant skills. So if you

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,800
wished that you had an AI agent that had

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,879
relevant skills, I believe that this is

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,719
probably the most important thing that

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,520
you could be studying right now. And so

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,879
in this video, we're going to talk about

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,039
how to set up Claude skills. We're also

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,399
going to talk about how to use Claude

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,800
code as a general agent. And we're going

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,559
to talk about how you need to set up

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,840
your skill.md file and what folders. And

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm going to show you how to just use AI

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,399
to create these skills. Let's talk about

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
building a general agent with relevant

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,920
skills for your business. Whether you're

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,680
a content creator, business owner,

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,439
aspiring entrepreneur, we're going to

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,240
build an agent with relevant skills to

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,920
you and we're going to use that agent.

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,159
Let's dive in. Okay. So, we're going to

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,920
start off by talking about what is a

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,840
coding agent. You may have heard of

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,280
lovable and this video is not about

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,400
lovable. We're not even going to use

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,080
lovable. I just wanted to make a point

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
real quick. So many people are talking

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,759
about vibe coding. You can use tools

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,640
like lovable, replet, vibe code. These

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,720
are coding agents that you can use to

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,079
build apps. And whenever I go to lovable

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,680
and type in uh make a landing

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,200
landing page about pizza

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
right now, what it's doing is it's

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,399
spinning up a sandbox which is basically

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,520
a virtual computer and it's going to run

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,720
an AI agent or an AI coding agent on the

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
side. Now, it's going to generate a

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,920
bunch of files within a directory or

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,439
codebase, and those files are going to

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,159
make an app. And so, this is an AI

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,360
coding agent at work building an app.

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,920
Okay, so it's done. The lovable coding

56
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,160
agent took my prompt, make a landing

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,640
page about pizza. It generated all of

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
the files. This coding agent decided

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,800
what files it needed to generate. it

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,040
generated them and then it probably

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,400
reviewed those files and then it ran the

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
program in a virtual computer somewhere

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000
so I can see it on my uh browser because

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,239
this is within a web browser and so this

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,800
is an example of an agent made

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
specifically for creating simple

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,440
applications a very narrow agent

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,599
experience where it's made specifically

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,560
for creating certain types of apps with

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,879
certain stacks and we could do this same

71
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,200
thing on our computer, right? We could

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
do the same thing on our computer. If we

73
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,080
were to go to Finder, we can just go

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
straight into our downloads, right? We

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,599
can go straight into our downloads and

76
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,319
we could go new folder. We can go like

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,800
this. We can say using quad code, right?

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,760
So, we don't even need any IDE or

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,080
something like cursor or lovable. I can

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
open a terminal window. I can open a new

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,720
terminal at this folder and we can just

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,360
run claude. So now we're running claude

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
code in this empty folder called using

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,040
claude code which is an empty folder and

85
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,840
I can just say please build a beautiful

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,280
amazing landing page for my pizza shop

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,080
Riley's Pizza Shop. Make it in the style

88
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
of neo brutalism mixed with a friendly

89
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
pizza energy. So just like lovable, we

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,840
can run this and claude code in this

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,080
empty folder is going to create the

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,640
application right here. Okay, check this

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,519
out. It just generated an index.html

94
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
file. And there we go. It created a file

95
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,080
the same way that Lovable is creating

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
all the different files and putting them

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,159
in a folder in some virtual machine.

98
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,159
It's just a virtual computer. We're

99
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,239
doing this on our computer. It's doing

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,720
the same exact thing Lovable is doing.

101
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,879
And the point I want to make here, you

102
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,680
can just use these coding models on your

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,880
computer and coding files, right? This

104
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,759
is an HTML file and this is a CSS file.

105
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,800
This is not the only type of file you

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,320
can create with cloud code. You can

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,440
create any type of file. So it is done.

108
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
And if we just copy this link right here

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,720
and we paste in localhost80,

110
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
we can run this on our computer. This is

111
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,520
running locally on our computer. where

112
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,600
Lovable in Lovable's case, it just

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
created a virtual machine and it ran it

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,960
on that computer and it showed you what

115
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
it created on the browser. Now, we're

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,919
running this fully on our computer and

117
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,960
we didn't use any like software in

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,560
between. We generated the code files

119
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,520
with an AI coding agent on our computer.

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,240
It used an AI model from anthropic

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
servers to create those files. So that's

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,960
where it costs money, but we didn't use

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,440
any other software other than getting

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Claude to generate all the files. And

125
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,000
we're running it on our MacBook Pro. And

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
this is the website that it created. And

127
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,840
you'll notice that in my opinion, I've

128
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
tested every single one of these coding

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,199
agents. Just raw Claude code is the best

130
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,280
in the world. So Replet and lovable,

131
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,720
they have their own coding agents.

132
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
Claude Code out of the box is better

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,039
than all of them. And so what I want to

134
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,280
explain now is how you can use this as a

135
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,720
general agent. So this right here is

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,440
Obsidian. And this is just a basic notes

137
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,160
app where every file instead of the

138
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,680
files uh being an HTML file or a

139
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
JavaScript file or a CSS file which

140
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,560
ultimately created this uh application

141
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,000
that we can use. Instead of it being one

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
of those types of files, these are all

143
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,840
markdown files. So the way that I use

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,720
general agents is I actually use claude

145
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,919
code at the same location as my notes

146
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,319
like this is my agent workspace. This is

147
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,680
kind of how I think about this. This is

148
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,639
a notebook and Riley Brown uses this as

149
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,479
his personal notebook so that he can be

150
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,560
a better CMO and co-founder of the Vibe

151
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,960
Code app. And I basically state all of

152
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,440
my goals. Why am I stating this? I I

153
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
know my goals. Why am I writing this?

154
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,319
because I don't use this by myself. I

155
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,319
use this with my general agent which is

156
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,800
Claude Code. And what I can do here is I

157
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,280
can actually click on this or I can

158
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,600
rightclick on this and hit reveal in

159
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,479
Finder. So here we can see Riley content

160
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,479
creation. That's basically what I called

161
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,520
this file. And you'll see here all of

162
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,600
these different files here. Um like this

163
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,919
is just a wrapper of these files that

164
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,520
are showing up on my computer, right?

165
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,319
This is just in my computer. And so the

166
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,520
same way that I ran claude code in a new

167
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,000
folder, I can run claude code in this

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,400
folder. So I can reveal this in finder.

169
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
What I'm going to do is I'm going to

170
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,599
rightclick services, new terminal at

171
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,240
folder, right? New terminal at folder.

172
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
Now you can see here that it is running.

173
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
So we're in this folder right here,

174
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,919
which is the same folder where all of

175
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,240
this is located. And now we can run uh

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
claude. And so now we have cloud code

177
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,000
running in the folder that has all of my

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,919
notes. And so I can use it with cloud

179
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,560
code. So I could go into tasks, right?

180
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
And and this is how I keep track of my

181
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
tasks. I could go into Q. Um let's say

182
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,639
these are both done, right? This is

183
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,400
these are the things that I want to do.

184
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
Um and so in my queue, one thing that I

185
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,639
do want to do, and I can just drag this

186
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
in here. One thing that I do want to do

187
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,599
is I want to explain Claude skills to my

188
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,879
audience and make a video. Right? This

189
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,319
is one thing I really want to do. Um I

190
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,199
want to um share the file structure um

191
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,520
with of Claude skills. And then I want

192
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,400
to take my notebook and examine what

193
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,039
Claude skills would be useful for me to

194
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,520
create. And I'm I'm uh do this on this

195
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,400
page. Don't create or edit any other

196
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,720
files. Just make a plan and do it. Okay.

197
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,400
So, we just created this markdown file

198
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,319
of this thing that I want to do. The

199
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,919
cool thing is I can just ask Claude Code

200
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,720
to do it. I can just say, "Do what's in

201
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
my queue." Right? That's all I need to

202
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,639
say. I can say, "Yo, do what's in my

203
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,199
queue." And because the first thing that

204
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,800
this agent's going to do is analyze the

205
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,279
readme file. It's going to see how it's

206
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,640
organized, right? It's going to know

207
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,959
that there's tasks. It's going to know

208
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,120
what the queue is, draft tasks. So, it's

209
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
just going to know to check the queue.

210
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,719
And because Claude Code is such a

211
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,440
powerful agent and it's really good at

212
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,680
looking through the code base, in this

213
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,360
case, which is just a bunch of my notes,

214
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
it's going to find the right location.

215
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,040
It's really smart. And it's going to

216
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,560
find this page, and it's just going to

217
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
do what I want it to do. And we'll just

218
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
wait for Cloud Code to do that. And

219
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,640
you'll see here that we never said to

220
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
look at this file. It doesn't know that

221
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,640
I have this file open. It just found

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,320
what's in my queue. And you can see here

223
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
it's examining notebook for skill ideas.

224
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,800
It found the right file and now it's

225
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
creating the relevant things. Allow it

226
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,200
to edit this session. Boom. Look at

227
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,440
that. So, it just added all of this. It

228
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,480
added all of this

229
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
to this document. It told us what skills

230
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,040
are, right? And it told us that uh from

231
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,760
the anthropic skills repo, it it

232
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
basically did research. It found uh the

233
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,920
clawed skills repo. And now it is

234
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
telling us that you can create within

235
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,120
the claude.md file. You can create a

236
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
skill by creating a folder with the

237
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
skill name. And inside that folder, it

238
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,600
needs to have a claude or a skill.md

239
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,480
file. And then you can put optional uh

240
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,880
resources within that folder. And so you

241
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,440
can even put assets, references, etc.

242
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,880
And I'll get to that in just a second.

243
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
The point I wanted to make is the same

244
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,720
way lovable was a coding specific

245
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
example of using an agent. This is a

246
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,760
notes specific example for using an

247
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
agent. So I promise you we are we're

248
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,720
working our way up to creating claude

249
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,160
skills. I just wanted to illustrate the

250
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,079
point. I wanted to talk about what a

251
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,760
domain specific agent was like the

252
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,839
lovable agent that can create apps. Then

253
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,920
I showed you a note takingaking example

254
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,760
where you can use claude code as a

255
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,360
general agent. Now, we're going to use

256
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
it in a wide openen world within cursor.

257
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
And we can do literally whatever we

258
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,240
want. I like to use cursor because it's

259
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,880
just the best in my opinion for quickly

260
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,800
using claude code. And it's ironic

261
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,839
because I use we can just say claude

262
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,160
code skills. So, what uh we're going to

263
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,079
be creating claude skills in this

264
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,040
project. So, I'll just name it that. And

265
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,800
now it is opening up this directory in

266
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,160
an IDE. So cloud uh a cursor is just an

267
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,279
IDE like VS Code where you can view all

268
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,519
the files. And so the way that I vibe

269
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,880
code is I'm just going to come in here

270
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,000
and the first thing that I'm going to do

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,680
is hit command J. We're going to open up

272
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,880
the terminal and we're going to type

273
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
claude. Then we're going to press this

274
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,240
right here to open up the side panel.

275
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,519
And so now we have Claude code on the

276
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,120
left or on the right. controlling this

277
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,079
directory which is claude code skills

278
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,079
and what we're going to do here is I'm

279
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,000
going to say please take a look at this

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
direct or at this repo and I'm going to

281
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,839
paste this GitHub uh to the anthropic

282
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,519
skills right here please create one

283
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,480
simple skill in the right format so that

284
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,600
you will use this skill when you need

285
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
to. Okay. So, right now it's creating an

286
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,000
example skill. What it's going to do is

287
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,360
it's going to create a cloud file. It's

288
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,000
going to create a cloud file. As you can

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,279
see here, it's created this.cloud file.

290
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,920
It's also going to create a skills

291
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,839
folder as you'll see in just a second.

292
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,360
Okay, there you go. It created a folder

293
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
called.cloud

294
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
and then it created a skills folder

295
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
within that. And then it has other

296
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,160
folders beneath it. So it created this

297
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,880
summarized folder with a skill MD.

298
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
That's all you need to create a skill.

299
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
You just need to put in the docloud

300
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,680
folder because cloud code knows to look

301
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,519
in thecloud folder for certain things

302
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,000
like sub aents and now skills. We're not

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,440
talking about sub aents in this video.

304
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,279
We're just talking about skills. So we

305
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
created the skills folder. And within

306
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,880
this folder, right, we see this

307
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,480
skill.md.

308
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,040
And every single skill.mmd file should

309
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,680
be formatted with the name and

310
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,639
description. Right? It should have a

311
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,959
name and description. You can see here

312
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,560
that this one that I've created is

313
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,040
called brand voice, which is skill

314
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,680
number one. And then there is a name and

315
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,600
description. And so the name is just a

316
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,959
human-friendly title. It can be

317
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,760
anything. But the crucial part is this

318
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,839
description because it tells Claude code

319
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,040
when to use this skill. And so we're

320
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,079
reaching a point where you can get

321
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,680
agents to do things with a simple

322
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,000
markdown file. But what you need to do

323
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,279
is you need to make sure that you format

324
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,000
it correctly so Cloud Code knows when to

325
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
follow your instructions. Because

326
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,760
basically all skills are the way that I

327
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
think about them is they are just SOPs

328
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,320
or standard operating procedures. SOPs

329
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,440
for agents. And so right these are

330
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,680
instructions on what to do in certain

331
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,480
scenarios. And if you put a high quality

332
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
description, it'll know what instruction

333
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,519
manual or SOP to use when it needs to do

334
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,000
a specific task. And so I don't really

335
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
want to use this summarize skill. I

336
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
actually want to create a skill that's

337
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,399
much more relevant to me. Okay. So I

338
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,600
just want to show you what I've been

339
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,320
doing. I've been annotating. I've been

340
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,880
annotating my Twitter posts because I

341
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,040
can give these to Claude. I can put

342
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,199
these in Claude skills so that the agent

343
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,800
knows how I post. And so I can say short

344
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,880
video attached to this photo. This is a

345
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,240
Twitter account that I run by the way

346
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
that helps me grow Vibe Code. And I can

347
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,240
say um uh senior vibe coder

348
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,720
is ragebait

349
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,880
and works. I don't do this often, right?

350
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
Okay. And I just put this directly on

351
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,000
the image. And it helps me kind of

352
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,519
annotate my images here. And I'm just

353
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,839
going to hit I'm just going to exit out.

354
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,240
Hit save. And we can save all these. And

355
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,519
so what we can do here is we can just

356
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,680
take all of these files. We can drag

357
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,199
them in here. And what I'm going to do

358
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,560
is I'm just going to put a new skill

359
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,120
here. And what we can do is we can just

360
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,440
drag these images in here. Now we're

361
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
going to go to cloud code. I want you to

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,760
replace this uh summarize skill. And

363
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,120
because this is a folder, right? Uh I

364
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,160
can just type at summarize, right? I can

365
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,360
say replace this summarize skill. Uh

366
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,560
this skill, the whole summarize skill uh

367
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,160
should be replaced with a Twitter post X

368
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,519
post skill. This skill should allow the

369
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,959
agent to create tweets in my style and

370
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,079
use the images that are in the at new in

371
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,399
the new skill here folder as a

372
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,040
reference. So please create that skill

373
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,199
now. So we're basically going to tell

374
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,600
cloud code to analyze these images. It's

375
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,440
going to look for patterns in how I

376
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
speak. And actually one thing I can

377
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,800
mention, I just hit the backspace.

378
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,759
Just know the red text in these images

379
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,000
are annotations. So that's not part of

380
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,759
the post. These are my annotations to

381
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,600
you on why I did certain things. So take

382
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
that into consideration when

383
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
constructing this skill, right? So I

384
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
annotated why I did what I did. So this

385
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,040
gives some extra context to Cloud Code

386
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,880
and it's going to packages it package it

387
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,959
as a skill. And so in theory whenever I

388
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,800
ask for a Twitter post to claude code in

389
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,519
the future uh within this repo it should

390
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,079
be able to do it in my style because

391
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
I've given it relevant context. Okay. So

392
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,519
there you go. It created this skill.md

393
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,000
file and all it did was analyze all of

394
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,120
those images. It converted them into

395
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,959
these uh markdown formats and it

396
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,279
converted it into a skill. What it

397
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,399
didn't do is I didn't specify this. Uh

398
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,079
that was just a temporary folder. Please

399
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,800
remove that folder, but add those images

400
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,839
into that skill folder as references

401
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,360
because this doesn't need to be here.

402
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,399
This can just go into the skill and

403
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,800
right. So right now we have two skills.

404
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,240
We're going to add another skill in just

405
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,959
a second. So we have one skill and every

406
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,440
skill needs a claw.md file. So it just

407
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,040
created this and now it has these

408
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,680
references that it can use right here.

409
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,199
What we can do if we want references

410
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,160
uh to posts

411
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,079
and we can select all of these and we

412
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,559
can just like move them in here.

413
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,120
So we have references and then the

414
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,760
skill.md file. You need this skill.md

415
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,640
file, right? And so what we can do, I

416
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,000
want you to create a markdown file in

417
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
the root. And when I say in the root, I

418
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,039
mean right there's the the folder that

419
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,440
we opened up originally which is claude

420
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,679
code skills. This is the root folder. So

421
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,480
it should put it in below thecloud

422
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
folder. The dotcloud folder is also in

423
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,480
the root. The skills folder is in the

424
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,799
do.cloud folder. Thus not in the root.

425
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,280
Just wanted to be clear. uh in the root

426
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,679
and come up with 10

427
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,840
ideas for the Twitter copy based on my

428
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,280
last video where I explained Claude

429
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,960
skills

430
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
should match and then I can uh give it

431
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,240
that GitHub repo link I mentioned skills

432
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,520
and explained why it's important.

433
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,120
important for general use cases for like

434
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,880
marketing

435
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,799
and as general agent. Okay. So, let's

436
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,320
say I made this video because I'm making

437
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,919
this video right now. What I would

438
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,679
probably do is feed in the transcript of

439
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,840
this video and then it would generate 10

440
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,760
options. So, it would have more context

441
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,120
of the video we're creating. But since

442
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
I'm making the video right now, I can't

443
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,280
give it the transcript. Um, but that's

444
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,679
okay. It's going to create a markdown

445
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,520
file in the root and it's going to use

446
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,400
this skill. Okay, so it is done. Okay,

447
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,200
you'll see that when you see this green

448
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,919
dot and it shows expost right here. When

449
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,520
you see this green dot and it has

450
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,720
expost, that means it's using that

451
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,559
skill, right? It is using the expost

452
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,160
skill.

453
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,679
And we're going to allow it to create

454
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,360
these files. And boom, Twitter ideas.

455
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,640
So, here we go. Cloud Code just became a

456
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,120
general agent, not a chatbot, an agent

457
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,320
that does your workflows. Enthropic just

458
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,640
released skills, reusable prompt

459
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
templates, invoke with slash commands,

460
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,720
marketing teams. Okay, so this is really

461
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,280
good. Oh my, this shouldn't be possible.

462
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,440
I turned Claude into my personal

463
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,320
marketing team. Social media copy on

464
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
demand, email sequences in seconds,

465
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,440
brand voice locked in permanently. Zero

466
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
prompting every time. How Claude skills

467
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,280
one markdown file infinite workflows.

468
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,280
This is very good. So it wrote this in

469
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,320
my voice using this skill. But it gets

470
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,760
much cooler than this. So if we were to

471
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,919
go to um let's go to arc. So we're going

472
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,600
to go to typefully.com. And in typefully

473
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,720
we can go to settings and we could go to

474
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,600
API and we can hit new API key. And so

475
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,960
this is going to be test key

476
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,799
for me. Create API key. I'm going to

477
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
delete this right after this video. And

478
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,720
then what I'm going to do is I'm going

479
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,039
to click on this docs. And this explains

480
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,760
exactly how to use this API key. So,

481
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,039
what I'm trying to do here is I don't

482
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,880
want it to just come up with ideas. I

483
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,200
want them to draft them in this tool

484
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,120
where I can post directly to social

485
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,039
media. So, in theory, I could have an

486
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,960
agent uh come up with tweets uh and

487
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,480
automatically

488
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,320
draft them within Titefully because

489
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,600
that's what you can do here on this

490
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,120
platform, right? We could have it

491
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,640
directly post this as a um a draft here,

492
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,799
right? It can schedule a new draft. And

493
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,919
so, that's exactly what I'm going to

494
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,679
tell it. So I want you to add to our

495
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,120
x post skill. I'm using the software

496
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,440
typley and I want you to instead of

497
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,960
basically instead of putting these in a

498
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,760
document, I want you to actually

499
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,280
directly schedule these as a draft on

500
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,120
tightfully. And so I am going to give it

501
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,280
these docs to the API. Here are the docs

502
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,559
to read. Here is my API key. It is in a

503
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,720
text file, right? So I don't want to

504
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,080
expose it. What I'm going to do is I'm

505
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,960
just going to go I'm going to go key.txt

506
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,280
txt. I'm going to paste my key right

507
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,600
here. So, I pasted my key in this file

508
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,039
and I can just go at key.txt.

509
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,520
It is here. Please add to the skill

510
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,159
using claude skills. And I'm going to

511
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,559
mention this link right here. Please

512
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,360
make this skill such that it schedules

513
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,280
it as a draft to this typefully account.

514
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,919
It should not post or schedule. Okay,

515
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,480
now we're going to wait for the skill

516
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,480
called expost to be uh messed with.

517
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,760
Okay, so it is done. And here we can see

518
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,039
that your accounts available is Riley

519
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,520
Brown vibe code vibe coding explained.

520
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,200
Okay, so this works. Maybe maybe uh

521
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,799
please test this by um drafting

522
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,760
one of the items in the list

523
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,200
that we generated in and then we can

524
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
just go claude skills Twitter ideas.

525
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,600
Okay. Okay. It looks like it is done. If

526
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,240
we come back here. Okay. It created

527
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,480
this, right? It created this on vibe

528
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
coding explained. Okay. Now on the Riley

529
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,880
Brown account, draft a post that says,

530
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,000
"Hi, this is a test." Okay, so it's

531
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,760
done. If we go back to Arc, we go to

532
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
Riley.

533
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,840
Here we go. We see, "Hi, this is a test.

534
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,559
This was 34 seconds ago." So that's

535
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,720
pretty cool. We can have it draft posts.

536
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,480
I'm going to just reset the context

537
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,200
here. Um, so we're opening up a new

538
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,480
cloud instance to reset it, right? We're

539
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
resetting it uh so that there's no

540
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,120
context in here. And I'm going to say, I

541
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,559
just created a tightfully

542
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,159
video that explains how I created a

543
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,400
Claude code skill in order to uh post on

544
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
all my Twitter accounts via Typefully. I

545
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,960
want you to draft up three exposts and

546
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,880
draft them on Typefully on the Vibe

547
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,559
Coding Explained account. Oops, I

548
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,000
misspelled it. Typefully

549
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,280
is the app.

550
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,039
Okay, so we interrupted it, but it was

551
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,960
using the Expost skill. It should go

552
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,240
back to using the Expost skill. Okay, do

553
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,000
I want to proceed? Yes. Okay, so the

554
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,679
drafts were created. Oo, it has a link

555
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,600
associated with it. Wait, what happens

556
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,440
if we just go to this link? Wow,

557
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,840
skills repo. It even included that repo.

558
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,679
No way. You can build custom skills for

559
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,679
cloud code, automate repetitive

560
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,600
workflows, create one-click commands,

561
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,360
share skills across projects. Zero

562
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,240
coding required. Just dropped a full

563
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,480
walkth through how to do this. Wow.

564
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,840
Okay, so it created these posts using

565
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,320
the typefully or the expost skill and in

566
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,000
this skill.md file, it has access to

567
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,400
this code, right? You can it has this

568
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,880
code that I can that the claude code can

569
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,039
use to post this on social media. And

570
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,559
what I need to do now is I need to

571
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,400
delete my API key because I probably

572
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
exposed it. All right, so there you go.

573
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,200
We just created a general agent and we

574
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,919
gave it a skill. And you know what? I

575
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,760
think that's enough for you to get

576
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,600
started. I don't want to like go crazy

577
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,480
and create like an agent swarm or an

578
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,400
agent with a ton of different skills,

579
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,360
but we just created a we used claude

580
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,279
within cursor to create an agent. And

581
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,760
then we just created one simple skill.

582
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,279
And this is enough for you to get

583
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,440
started because as you saw, I just gave

584
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
it the link which I'll put in the

585
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,120
description to the Claude code skills.

586
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,039
So claude code can make your skills for

587
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,080
you and remember you just create you

588
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,240
know you have the root folder right and

589
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,480
then within your project you just have

590
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,000
aclad pro uh folder then you have

591
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,279
another folder uh which is your skills

592
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,320
folder and then within that you just

593
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,559
have the skill name. So this is just

594
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,200
skill uh skill-1 folder and then in here

595
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,520
you have a uh a skill

596
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,640
md file and within that file it will

597
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,320
have a name and description and cloud

598
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,760
code will do that for you. Just make

599
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,919
sure that when you create these skills

600
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,120
right because you can create many of

601
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,360
these. You can create skill one which we

602
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,919
did um and we didn't create more than

603
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,919
one skill right you can create as many

604
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,679
skills as you want. I wouldn't go

605
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,080
overboard, but if you want to create a

606
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,760
general purpose agent and use Cloud

607
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Code, this is how you can do it. And you

608
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,159
can create a bunch of different skills.

609
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,919
And so, in the description down below

610
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,919
this video, you'll find a link to a

611
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
webinar. I'm just going to do like a big

612
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,080
live stream where we're going to create

613
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,520
a really cool uh agent interface with a

614
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,799
ton of different skills. We're going to

615
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,640
do it live. It's going to be like 3 to

616
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,559
four hours long. And so, if you want to

617
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,000
sign up for that, that's in the

618
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,159
description. It's going to be sick. But

619
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,720
uh yeah, this is just part two of my

620
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,039
general agent series. I made part one on

621
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,799
Obsidian and I'm just going to continue

622
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,640
this because I'm becoming much more

623
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,000
interested in creating agents with

624
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,480
skills. And in the future, we're going

625
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,720
to mix agent skills with also apps.

626
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,000
We're going to create a little interface

627
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,679
where we can alternate between using an

628
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,320
app that we create and the agent and we

629
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,400
can create things that both me and the

630
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,919
agent can use. It's going to be like an

631
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,720
agent interface or an agent workspace.

632
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,679
And that's what we're going to talk

633
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,760
about in the next video. Uh so thank you

634
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,960
guys for watching.
